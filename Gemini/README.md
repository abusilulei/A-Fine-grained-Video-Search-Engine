Large Language Models (LLMs) can also be used to generate captions for images and videos. 

Also, we can generate titles and summaries for videos using LLMs.

This works better than traditional computer vision models (e.g. Florence-2) because LLMs have a better understanding of context and can generate more accurate and relevant captions.

Here, I used a wide range gemini models from Google DeepMind to generate captions, titles, and summaries for videos.
