# Normalizing
This folder includes code for normalizing json data into csv tables that can be inserted into relational databases (particularly PostgreSQL).

I normalized the data into 3rd normal form (3NF) to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

I am using pandas library for this purpose. You can find more details about pandas [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/).
